        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>There are methods for accessing the Web in alternative
            mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with
            disabilities.
            These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical,
            speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some
            combination.
            Accessibility features also help people with temporary
            disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their
            abilities change.
            The Web receives information as well as providing
            information and interacting with society. The World Wide
            Web Consortium claims that it
            is essential that the Web be accessible, so it can provide
            equal access and equal opportunity to people with
            disabilities.
            Tim Berners-Lee once noted, "T console.log(parent); or may
            not be using assistive technology.When a web page asks
            for, and the user supplies, personally
            identifiable information—such as their real name, address,
            e-mail address, etc. web-based entities can associate
            current web traffic
            with that individual. If the website uses HTTP cookies,
            username, and password authentication, or other tracking
            techniques, it can
            relate other web visits, before and after, to the
            identifiable information provided. In this way, a
            web-based organization can develop and
            build a profile of the individual people who use its site
            or sites. It may be able to build a record for an
            individual that includes
            information about their leisure activities, their shopping
            interests, their profession, and other aspects of their
            demographic profile.
            These profiles are of potential interest to marketers,
            advertisers, and others. Depending on the website's terms
            and conditions and the
            local laws that apply information from these profiles may
            be sold, shared, or passed to other organizations without
            the user being informed.
            For many ordinary people, this means little more than some
            unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily
            relevant advertising on a
            future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent
            indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of
            further targeted
            marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement,
            counter-terrorism, and espionage agencies can also
            identify, target, and track
            individuals based on their interests or proclivities on
            the Web. </p>
