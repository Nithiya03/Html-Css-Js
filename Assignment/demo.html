            <h2>History of web</h2>
            <p>In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee developed the foundation for the
                Web- HTTP, HTML, a browser, a server, and the first website in
                order to manage documentation at CERN.[2] [4]

                While the Web was a success at CERN, it was not very
                popular elsewhere. In two years, there were only 50
                websites.[5]

                After the NCSA released Mosaic, a graphical browser that
                could display inline images[6] and submit forms,[7] and
                HTTPd, a server that could process forms (see CGI), the
                Web became very popular with thousands of websites
                springing up in less than a year.[8]

                In 1994, Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape
                and released Navigator which introduced Java and
                Javascript to the Web. It quickly became the dominant
                browser. In 1995, Netscape had a very successful IPO which
                triggered a frenzy for the Web and started the dot-com
                bubble.[9]

                Microsoft responded by developing their own browser,
                Internet Explorer. By bundling it with Windows, it became
                the dominant browser for 14 years.[10]

                Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium
                (W3C) which created XML in 1996 and recommended replacing
                HTML with stricter XHTML.[11]

                In the meantime, developers began exploiting an IE feature
                called XMLHttpRequest to make Ajax applications and
                launched the Web 2.0 revolution.

                Mozilla, Opera, and Apple rejected XHTML and created the
                WHATWG which developed HTML5.[12]

                In 2009, the W3C conceded and abandoned XHTML[13] and in
                2019, ceded control of the HTML specification to the
                WHATWG.[14] </p>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>There are methods for accessing the Web in alternative
                mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with
                disabilities.
                These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical,
                speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some
                combination.
                Accessibility features also help people with temporary
                disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their
                abilities change.
                The Web receives information as well as providing
                information and interacting with society. The World Wide
                Web Consortium claims that it
                is essential that the Web be accessible, so it can provide
                equal access and equal opportunity to people with
                disabilities.
                Tim Berners-Lee once noted, "T console.log(parent); or may
                not be using assistive technology.When a web page asks
                for, and the user supplies, personally
                identifiable informationâ€”such as their real name, address,
                e-mail address, etc. web-based entities can associate
                current web traffic
                with that individual. If the website uses HTTP cookies,
                username, and password authentication, or other tracking
                techniques, it can
                relate other web visits, before and after, to the
                identifiable information provided. In this way, a
                web-based organization can develop and
                build a profile of the individual people who use its site
                or sites. It may be able to build a record for an
                individual that includes
                information about their leisure activities, their shopping
                interests, their profession, and other aspects of their
                demographic profile.
                These profiles are of potential interest to marketers,
                advertisers, and others. Depending on the website's terms
                and conditions and the
                local laws that apply information from these profiles may
                be sold, shared, or passed to other organizations without
                the user being informed.
                For many ordinary people, this means little more than some
                unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily
                relevant advertising on a
                future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent
                indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of
                further targeted
                marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement,
                counter-terrorism, and espionage agencies can also
                identify, target, and track
                individuals based on their interests or proclivities on
                the Web. </p>
