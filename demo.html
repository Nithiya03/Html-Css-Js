            <h2>History of web</h2>
            <p>In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee developed the foundation for the Web- HTTP, HTML, a browser, a server, and the first website in order to manage documentation at CERN.[2] [4]

                While the Web was a success at CERN, it was not very popular elsewhere. In two years, there were only 50 websites.[5]
                
                After the NCSA released Mosaic, a graphical browser that could display inline images[6] and submit forms,[7] and HTTPd, a server that could process forms (see CGI), the Web became very popular with thousands of websites springing up in less than a year.[8]
                
                In 1994, Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape and released Navigator which introduced Java and Javascript to the Web. It quickly became the dominant browser. In 1995, Netscape had a very successful IPO which triggered a frenzy for the Web and started the dot-com bubble.[9]
                
                Microsoft responded by developing their own browser, Internet Explorer. By bundling it with Windows, it became the dominant browser for 14 years.[10]
                
                Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which created XML in 1996 and recommended replacing HTML with stricter XHTML.[11]
                
                In the meantime, developers began exploiting an IE feature called XMLHttpRequest to make Ajax applications and launched the Web 2.0 revolution.
                
                Mozilla, Opera, and Apple rejected XHTML and created the WHATWG which developed HTML5.[12]
                
                In 2009, the W3C conceded and abandoned XHTML[13] and in 2019, ceded control of the HTML specification to the WHATWG.[14] </p>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>There are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with disabilities. 
                These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination. 
                Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change.
                The Web receives information as well as providing information and interacting with society. The World Wide Web Consortium claims that it
                is essential that the Web be accessible, so it can provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with disabilities.
                Tim Berners-Lee once noted, "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential 
                aspect."[69] Many countries regulate web accessibility as a requirement for websites.[71] International co-operation in the W3C Web 
                Accessibility Initiative led to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web 
                accessible to persons who may or may not be using assistive technology.When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally 
                identifiable informationâ€”such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc. web-based entities can associate current web traffic 
                with that individual. If the website uses HTTP cookies, username, and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can 
                relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way, a web-based organization can develop and 
                build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes 
                information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their demographic profile. 
                These profiles are of potential interest to marketers, advertisers, and others. Depending on the website's terms and conditions and the 
                local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organizations without the user being informed. 
                For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a
                future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted 
                marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target, and track 
                individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web. </p>
